title: "Loop data, part 4: a bit of plotting"

This time I covered a couple of things - daily statistics calculations and also some really really basic time series plotting. I like daily statistics - and copied most of the code from my older project (older post on daily stats). I like the quick interactive plotting with hvplot but those plots don't render in a gist. Here's an example of the "explorer" function of hvplot (it basically builds a mini-panel app). 

I want to keep going with hvplot and really the whole holoviews ecosystem. I'd like to eventually make a dashboard/app to analyze and view Alma's CGM/pump data.
