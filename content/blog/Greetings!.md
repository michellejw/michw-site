I went to update my old website this morning (after not touching it for over a year) and - surprise, surprise - it was fatally broken. Luckily I was bored of that website anyway, so I logged into Bluehost and wiped it off the face of the earth so I could start fresh. And that's where we're at. 

The thing that brought me back to the ol' website was the fact that I'm looking at some of my daughter's diabetes data, and I always seem to want to share really nerdy code things. Especially things that - look, who knows - could help other people? 

Anyway, the more likely scenario is that I write a couple of posts and then get bored or busy or distracted, and never write another one again for two years, at which point I'll forget my password and the whole cycle will play out again. And on that note... see ya next time!
