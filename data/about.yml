  <p>I'm Michelle Weirathmueller. I have a PhD in oceanography and a background in underwater acoustics and signal processing. Over the past several years, much of my work has focused on animal movement modeling and underwater noise exposure assessments. I love writing code and diving into complex datasets, transforming them into intuitive graphics and interactive visualizations that make information accessible to everyone.</p>
  
  <p>I recently founded <a href="https://waveformanalytics.com">Waveform Analytics</a>, where I bring together my passion for data with my expertise in coding and visualization. At Waveform Analytics, I provide services in data visualization, data analysis, and scientific programming.</p>

  <p>With my background in science, engineering, and illustration, I’m your go-to person for projects that involve quantitative analysis, software development, science communication—or all of the above!</p>
